## FUN WITH FRITZ

Chess is meant to be fun – and that’s why the Fritz Web App has several different playing modes. On the "Amateur" level, you can beat him comfortably. On level "Club Player", you get realistic games where Fritz will actively allow tactic combinations. Switch him to "Master" and it will become tough. Fritz will know every opening variation ever played in master games. But you still have your chances: The innovative "Assisted Play" function will give you subtle hints and protect you from simple blunders. 

## TRAINING WITH FRITZ

Fritz has a fantastic training feature: "Assisted Calculation". During the game, you can calculate lines in any position by moving pieces "blindly" on the board. Fritz will assist you with several graphical hints to ensure that your variations are legal and tactically sound. You "only" have to do the visualization work. This boosts your calculation skills and also improves your chances against the chess program in the game. Fritz plays his openings from the LiveBook. That means it always knows the most recent theory and all relevant games every played. 

## PLAY OUT THE POSITION!

Practice makes perfect! You can play a position of your choice against Fritz - for example, from one of your favourite openings, and test how well you understand the position. Naturally, you can also save or download your game against Fritz.
